    Hi, my name is Haley and I'm a senior at MIT double majoring in computer science and engineering (6-3) and environmental engineering (1). 
    To finish up my double major, my expected graduation is in December 2024. 
</p>

<p>
    I am passionate about software development and engineering; since coming to MIT, I'm grateful to have been able to explore the field more 
    through a variety of interesting coursework and internship experiences. I have really enjoyed taking algorithms and operating systems, and 
    am currently taking one of my favorite classes, software studio. A few of my favorites internship experiences have been developing custom 
    programs for an environmental engineering firm in Hawaii and employing ML to understand native species variation for my research position
    at MIT.

    I grew up in an environment where coding and computer science were alien languages and after being exposed to their capabilities, I have 
    fallen in love with the field and am constantly in awe at it. I believe in, and am passionate about, using software to improve lives and 
    to make a positive impact on society. This is what I hope to continue to do.

    As for a little bit of fun information about myself, I'm from Oahu, Hawaii. For those who know me well, I enjoy hiking, surfing, and exploring. 
    I also play the acoustic guitar, like reading the classics, and am currently working on my cooking! I love a challenge and to dive headfirst 
    into new experiences, and I take that attitude with me in all of my work.
