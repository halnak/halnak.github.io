<p>
    Web-playable, interactive puzzle game: Galaxies. 
</p>

<p>
    This is an unfinished personal project I worked on for a few weeks in the Summer of 2023. The project focused on full implementation of the 
    drawing/aesthetic design, puzzle ADT, puzzle string parsing, and client interaction of the online puzzle game, Galaxies. More about the game 
    available on my GitHub. 
</p>

<p>
    During implementation, I focused on testing, then implemented a majority of the basic, crude functionality. Going forward, I hope to complete 
    the few unimplemented functions, optimize test checks and check reps (by overriding the equality function for lines and centers), and improve 
    the aesthetic of the client page.
