<p>
    This is a personal project adapted from a class project. I scoped and implemented a parser, puzzle abstract data type, and 
    interactive page for Galaxies, an interactive puzzle game where you draw galaxies around galaxy centers, indicated by dots. 
    Each galaxy must be rotationally symmetric about 180 degrees.
