</p>

<p>
    This is for an ongoing project in Software Studio (6.170/6.1040), the advanced software consutrction class I am taking this semester.
    This implementation is the front-end for my Fritter site, a spinoff of Twitter which emphasizes community through the use of multiple 
    Fritter Circles: membership circles for which users can join/be added to and then post to for a targeted feed. The front-end was developed
    using Vue.js, combined with the work from my back-end implementation. 
</p>

<p>
    This project is ongoing and I am continuing to update it. Currently, I am focusing on the pathways for circle creation and updating,
    and then will move onto like and refreet functionality.
