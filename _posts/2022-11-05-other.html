<p>
    Along with the projects outlined here, there are a variety of other projects that I have worked on/am working on:
</p>

<p>
    <b>Tree Crown Delineation</b>
</p>
<p>
    In my current research position, I am working on developing a tool to identify tree species from drone-flight RGB images on the Island of
    Hawaii. This process has included stitching together individual drone-flight images into a mosaic image using Sentera, separating out individual
    tree crowns user watershed segmentation and gamma correction algorithms (for shape delineation and color correction, respectively), and 
    separating out the final images for machine learning analysis using the Resnet 50 pretrained model for image analysis. 
</p>
<p>
    This project is still in the works. Watershed segmentation and gamma correction algorithms were implemented by me in Python in a lab-wide effort
    to recreate more expensive segmentation techniques such that this process can be used open-source for our agricultural partners in Hawaii.
    The ML modeling was done in Google Colab with Python. This project is still being developed for research, and will be publically posted
    post-analysis.

    <b>Re-Thrift: Thrifting App for Local Communities</b>
</p>
<p>
    In my software studio class (6.170/6.1040) I am currently working on a group project in which we are developing the back-end and front-end
    for a thrifting app, which will allow users to create and coordinate thrift events, collect and respond to donations, and post individual
    requests. Users will also be able to see a map of events in their area, filter by the events that they would like/or have and can donate,
    and can browse a catalog of pictures of the clothes that will be at a particular event populated by the in-app responses. 
</p>


<p>
    <b>Further xv6 Modifications</b>
</p>
<p>
    In my current operating systems class (6.039/6.1810) we are in the process of implementing further extensions of the xv6 Linux-based 
    operation system beyond the threading project displayed on this site. We have also implemented new system calls, page tables, traps,
    copy-on-write forking, network drivers, system locks, file systems, and mmap and munmap (for mapping memory address spaces).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Other classroom experiences</b>
</p>
<p>
    In other classes, for which I cannot post classwork code, I have worked on concurrency models (applied to multiplayer online games), 
    unit testing frameworks, and implementation of algorithms.
