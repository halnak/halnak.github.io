<p>
    AutoLISP code for generating CAD objects for report creation.
</p>

<p>
    This project focused on processing laboratory analyses into autoLISP routines that could be run in CAD Civil 3D (2021 and 2022) to 
    automatically generate layers, create mleaders with text, and format these objects in the appropriate industry style (as requested). 
    I looked into this as a project for a programming internship with an environmental engineering company where I wrote custom programs
    in several languages and platforms to automate engineering solutions.
