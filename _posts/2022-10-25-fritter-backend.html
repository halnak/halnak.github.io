    This is for an ongoing project in Software Studio (6.170/6.1040), the advanced software consutrction class I am taking this semester.
    This implementation is the back-end for my Fritter site, a spinoff of Twitter which emphasizes community through the use of multiple 
    Fritter Circles: membership circles for which users can join/be added to and then post to for a targeted feed. The site was built using
    MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. 
</p>

<p>
    This project is ongoing and I am continuing to update it. Note that the back-end is not yet finalized. The site can be interacted with by running 
    <code>npm start</code> and navigating to localhost:3000.
