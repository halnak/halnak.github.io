    This project creates a generator for translating field data into AutoLISP creation scripts, which can be imported into CAD Civil 3D to 
    create necessary AutoCAD objects used in engineering reports. This project stemmed from the need to quickly and accurately input large 
    amounts of field work data into AutoCAD for a fast turnaround on deliverable reports. This is an extension of my AutoLISP project, and 
    simply generates those .scr files directly from the fieldwork.
